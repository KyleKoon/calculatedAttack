COURSE TITLE: Game Design
MEETING TIME(S): Mon. and Wed. at 2pm
DESCRIPTION: This program creates the Calculated Attack Game. In this game, the user must solve math problems to kill off the attacking goblins.
There are three different levels of goblins with varying difficulties of math problems. The easiest goblin/problems move the fastest. 
The hardest move the slowest. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the goblins (solve all the math problems) and save your castle. 
The user must click on lane 1, 2, or 3, type their answer, and press enter. If it is correct, the goblin will be defeated. 
If not, the goblin will continue to approach. Complete all three levels and you win!
HONOR CODE: On my honor, I neither gave nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment. Signature: Kyle Koon
HOWTO: Download the .zip file and save in a folder. The necessary image files will be within this .zip file. Make sure that everything is extracted
in the same place. Run the program and play the game. Close out of the window when the game is over.
INPUT FILE: No input files are used besides the images I have included in the .zip file.
OUTPUT FILE: No output file is created.

RESOURCES: After reading "Guidelines for an effective design of serious games," I made it a point to reduce the "cognitive load" as it is called in the paper.
I did not want to burden the player with complex mechanics. The simple mechanics of clicking on a lane and typing an answer allow the user to learn more from
playing the game without added stress. The story element of the goblins vs the castle does not add any unnecessary mechanics, but it does make the game 
more enjoyable by adding a narrative element. The reduced cognitive load combined with the story allows the user to practice math in a fun and engaging way.
TUTORS: I did not receive help from any tutors or other students
COMMENTS: I assume that the user downloads the .zip file that I have submitted and correctly extracts the components. I also assume that the user
can solve linear equations, understands basic trigonometry, and can compute basic derivatives and integrals. In the future I would like to make
an easy or hard mode selector at the beginning, so that the user can select the difficulty of the game. The user must close the window 
and re-run the program if they want to play again.
