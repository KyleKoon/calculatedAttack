# calculatedAttack
This program creates the Calculated Attack Game. In this game, the user must solve math problems to kill off the attacking goblins.
There are three different levels of goblins with varying difficulties of math problems. The easiest goblin/problems move the fastest. 
The hardest move the slowest. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the goblins (solve all the math problems) and save your castle. 
The user must click on lane 1, 2, or 3, type their answer, and press enter. If it is correct, the goblin will be defeated. 
If not, the goblin will continue to approach. Complete all three levels and you win!
